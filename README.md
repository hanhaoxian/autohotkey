# autohotkey
my autohotkey config

about the capslock -> control, maybe autohotkey remaps key in runtime, its performance not good.
for example, ctrl(capslock actually) + h for backspace, press ctrl(capslock actually) and toggle h,  ctrl(capslock actually)it would not effect the second time.
Use sofeware like Sharpkeys to remap it.
